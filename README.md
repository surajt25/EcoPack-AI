### Sustainable Packaging Recommendation System

EcoPack AI is a machine learning-based web application that recommends eco-friendly packaging materials by optimizing cost and CO₂ emissions based on product and shipping conditions.

## System Architecture Overview

![architecture](images/architecture_new.png)

### Layer Description:

* **User Interface Layer** – Collects product inputs (category, fragility, shipping type, sustainability priority).
* **Application Layer (Flask)** – Processes API requests and connects frontend with ML models and database.
* **Machine Learning Layer** – Predicts packaging cost and CO₂ emissions, ranks materials.
* **Database Layer (PostgreSQL)** – Stores dataset and recommendation history.
* **Analytics Layer** – Displays insights, charts, and exportable reports.

# 📊 2️⃣ Dataset Description

The materials dataset was collected from Kaggle and HuggingFace and imported into PostgreSQL.

### Dataset Features:

* Material id
* Material name
* Strength
* Weight capacity
* Cost
* Biodegradibility score
* Co2score
* Recyclability percentage

### Data Preprocessing:

* Handled missing values
* Normalized numerical features
* Encoded categorical variables
* Feature selection for model training

# 🤖 3️⃣ Machine Learning Model Explanation

Two separate regression models were developed:

## 🔹 Random Forest (Cost Prediction)

* Used for predicting packaging cost
* Handles non-linear relationships
* Reduces overfitting through ensemble learning
* Performs well with structured tabular data

## 🔹 XGBoost (CO₂ Prediction & Ranking)

* Used to predict CO₂ footprint
* High accuracy using gradient boosting
* Efficient and scalable
* Handles complex feature interactions

### Ranking Logic

Final material ranking is based on:

* Predicted Cost
* Predicted CO₂ Emission
* Suitability Score
* Dynamic weighting based on sustainability priority

    Suitability Score ​= (Weco​×CO2norm​)+(Wcost​×Costnorm​)+(Wstrength​×Strengthnorm​)

Materials are filtered based on category, fragility, shipping type requirements before ranking.

# 📈 4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using:

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Measures average absolute prediction error
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Penalizes larger errors
* **R² Score** – Measures how well the model explains variance

Data was split into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

# 📊 5️⃣ Dashboard Explanation

The Business Intelligence Dashboard provides:

* Top 3 recommended materials
* Cost comparison charts
* CO₂ emission reduction analysis
* Material performance trends
* Exportable PDF/Excel reports

### Key Insights:

* Visual comparison of sustainability impact
* Cost efficiency tracking
* Historical recommendation analysis

The dashboard enables data-driven decision making for eco-friendly packaging selection.
